Hey Team... I thought it might be good idea to add this file where we can add notes, questions and comments for each other to view... kinda like a group chat forum ...

I have one idea regarding a question to ask... I think it would be valuable to know what is a acceptable average sentence length. IE how many words is too much or too small for a good average sentence so the user can get feedback to know if they have acceptable sentences.

yes or no? thoughts? 

Hey all, just updated questions.txt with some ideas.  

Good idea. It is more convenient for me to discuss here.
