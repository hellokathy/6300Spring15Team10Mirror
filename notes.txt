Hey Team... I thought it might be good idea to add this file where we can add notes, questions and comments for each other to view... kinda like a group chat forum ...


I have one idea regarding a question to ask... I think it would be valuable to know what is a acceptable average sentence length. IE how many words is too much or too small for a good average sentence so the user can get feedback to know if they have acceptable sentences.


yes or no? thoughts? 

Hey all, just updated questions.txt with some ideas.
