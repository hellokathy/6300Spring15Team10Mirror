1. As the coustomers may have the same name, I added a customerID attribute in the Customer class.
2. I assume the $10 single purchase discount and the "gold" status discount are two different awards.
3. The stall manager should be able to display a list of transactions for any customer(any customerID) by searching the recorded payments, and each payment/transaction contains (1)date, (2)amount and (3)whether discounts and which discounts were applied ( information of (3) is recorded by the attribute: appliedDiscountType).

Thank you.
Best regards,
