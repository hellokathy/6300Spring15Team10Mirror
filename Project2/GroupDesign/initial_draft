First off…I really enjoyed looking at everyone’s design. There is a lot of value in collaborating together and I learned valuable things from each of you. Here are my ideas going forward.


Design ideas:
Thoughts on Kkummerfeldt’s design:
I like how you have the methods in the manager class. I think all of them are valid and the association with the transaction class. One thing I am unsure about is how the Credit Card class isn’t directly connected / associated with transaction class.

Thoughts on Ldesimon’s design:
I like how customer class has two attributes of “year purchase total” and “reward amount” in addition to Boolean of isGold (rewards member). In connection with previous notes, I think stall manager needs more methods than only addCustomer(), editCustomer(), and displayTransactions().  

Thoughts on yzou66’s design:
I really like the reweards class with two sub-classes of singlePurchaseReward and GoldStatusReward along with their attributes and the association with ChangeGoldStatus and email method. And with previous comments, I think the Stall manager needs methods as outlined above. I also like the customer class “as is”.

Hey all, I'll just continue under here. -Ken


Jake:
+I like the idea of having the Discount as a class, it would make for a clear idea of which discount and how much is
being used for the transaction
+I like your choice of methods and placement for them
-I'm not sure about the attributes for the manager class; would Date refer to today's date? that would probably just
be part of the Date utility. And would the Discount boolean be better suited to the purchase class?  Some things
to think on


Lance:
+I rather like your choice of utilities and overall simplicity but thoroughness of the design.
+Your classes seem complete and the design is clear and easy to understand/follow
-The email part of the system is slightly ambiguous; would the customer class be initiating the email? how does the
class know if the transaction was over $100? Could both Customer and Transaction use email?
-From your design.md is seems the cards are stored by customer rather than standalone, perhaps an attribute of
Customer that holds these? A similar thought comes to mind regarding transactions.


Yanglei:
+Your design is very thorough and each class and connection is labeled clearly.
+I like that the manager is the center of the structure, the overall controller of the whole thing. That is
what I think of when I think of a manager of anything
-The design as a whole seems a bit more complicated than it needs to be.  You have some classes that could possibly be methods or attributes of another class and nearly every class seems to talk to nearly every other class in the
design
-The choice to have a CalendarYear utility but no date, yet have Date attributes as strings seems questionable to
me. Perhaps it would be simpler and more logical to have just a date class that encompasses both.

Thanks all, looking forward to more feedback!

Interesting looking at everyone’s design! I would like to share some thoughts.

Jake:
I really like your design. It is really neat and easy to understand. I especially like the part that you describe CardScanner and CardProcessingProvider and the Discount Class not the connection.
one question: Does the ManagerDisplay need a connection to Purchase(because of the ViewPurchases() operation)? 
one suggestion: it seems people use lower case letter for the first word in attributes and operations..(for example, people use viewPurchase() instead of ViewPurchase())..just nitpicking…

Kennith:
I really like your design. It is professional, clear and easy to understand. And I really like that you define aPastTransactons and aCreditCards in Customer.
two question: Is it better to place readCard() to CardScanner? Is it better if we can place some of the operations on the connection lines?

Lance:
I really like your design. It is so clear and easy to follow. I especially like that you make email a separate class and including Payment Processing Service ,Money and Operating System as utilities.
two questions: Can the stall manager change the Gold status reward percentage? Should the CreditCardScanner have a readCard() operation?
