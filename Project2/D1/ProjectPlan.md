# Project Plan

**Author**: Team 10

## 1 Introduction

The product to be developed is an android application, PReMS, which acts as a payment and rewards management system for mobile stalls.

## 2 Process Description

We will be using the waterfall method for this project which will consist of the following steps:

**Software Concept Phase**

*Entrace:* A customer comes to our team with a need
The first step for the project will be the creation of a software concept; the initial project idea will be  
elaborated and formed into an overview of the completed product. The overview will be a general description  
of the project, rather than a detailed set of steps, taking into account any known customer requrements  
and finishing with a project plan.
*Exit:* A clear overview is established via a completed project plan

**Requirements Analysis**

*Entrance:* A clear overview is established via a completed project plan
This phase will consist of gathering information regarding the project and developing functional and non-functional  
requirements for the system. In order to successfully complete this phase it is important to discover the  
specific needs from the customer to aid in developing accurate requirements and to prevent having to backtrack  
once the project is under way. Methods such as interviews, surveys, observation, research, and any other variety  
of requirements gathering methods are appropriate to ensure the success of the project as a whole. Once the  
needed information is acquired, functional and non-functional requirements will be developed and a requirements  
document, specifying the charactaristics of the system, will be completed.
*Exit:* Functional and non-functional requirements as well as a requirements document are all complete

**Design**

*Entrance:* Functional and non-functional requirements as well as a requirements document are all complete
This phase will be where a decision is made regarding the best way to develop the system specified in the requirements.  
Once detailed requirements are complete we will begin the software design by determining the objects needed for the  
system and what relations they have with one another, not by writing any actual code, but by representing these  
relationships with diagrams.
*Exit:* A complete set of diagrams detailing the design of the system and the contents of the user documentation (textual man page) is complete

**Coding and Debugging**

*Entrance:* A complete set of diagrams detailing the design of the system and the contents of the user documentation (textual man page) is complete
In this phase, the design is implemented by the developers through code and a rough product begins to emerge. A  
detailed design is needed to ensure that all necessary code, and no extraneous code, is written to complete the  
desired project. To ensure success in all parts of the system, debugging and light testing will be done as issues come up  
or after a section has been completed. 
*Exit:* Enough rounds of testing and coding have been completed and a product exists that fully implements the detailed design

**System Testing**

*Entrance:* Enough rounds of testing and coding have been completed and a product exists that fully implements the detailed design
Once the coding and debugging phase is complete and a full product exists, that product must be thoroughly tested.  
The goal of this phase will be to discover any inconsistencies between the completed system and the requirements.  
This will be through a detailed set of test cases that will be designed with specific requirements in mind and executed  
on the system. 
*Exit:* All tests pass without issue and the system is successful in meeting all of the functional and non-functional requirements.

## 4 Estimates

As a rough estimate, the expected combined effort hours of the team will be 70-80 hours total. 
This will give us a project tentatively by in the range of 600-700 lines of code.
