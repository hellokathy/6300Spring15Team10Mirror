# Project Plan

**Author**: Team 10

## 1 Introduction

The product to be developed is an android application, PReMS, which acts as a payment and rewards management system for mobile stalls.

## 2 Process Description

We will be using the Rational Unified Process for this project and will follow these steps:

**Inception**

*Entrance:* A customer comes to our team with a need
The first step for the project will be the creation of a software concept; the initial project idea will be  
elaborated and formed into an overview of the completed product. The overview will be a general description  
of the project, rather than a detailed set of steps, taking into account any known customer requirements.
*Exit:* A clear overview is established via a completed project plan, vision document, and initial use-case model.


**Elaboration**

*Entrance:* A clear overview is established via a completed project plan, vision document, and initial use-case model
This phase will consist of analyzing the problem domain, establishing architectural foundation, eliminating highest 
risk elements, and refining plan of activities and estimates. In order to successfully complete this phase it is important to discover the  
specific needs from the customer to aid in developing accurate requirements and to prevent having to backtrack  
once the project is under way. Methods such as interviews, surveys, observation, research, and any other variety  
of requirements gathering methods are appropriate to ensure the success of the project as a whole. Once the  
needed information is acquired, functional and non-functional requirements will be developed and a requirements  
document, specifying the characteristics of the system, will be completed.
*Exit:* Completed use-case model, supplementary requirements, design models, test plan

**Construction**

*Entrance:* A complete set of diagrams detailing the design of the system is complete
In this phase, the design is implemented by the developers through code and a rough product begins to emerge. A  
detailed design is needed to ensure that all necessary code, and no extraneous code, is written to complete the  
desired project. To ensure success in all parts of the system, debugging and light testing will be done as issues come up  
or after a section has been completed. 
*Exit:* Initial version of the final product (Beta release) is developed, all use-cases realized with traceability information,
user manual, test plan with partial results

**Transition**

*Entrance:* Beta version of the product is complete, user manual is developed, all use-cases exist with traceability information, test plan has most results filled out
Now we take the beta release of our product and refine it until it's complete and ready for release.
Any inconsistencies between the completed system and the requirements should be found before release.
To do this, our test plan will be executed and filled out.
*Exit:* Final release of the product, test plan is completed with all results passing

## 4 Estimates

As a rough estimate, the expected combined effort hours of the team will be 70-80 hours total. 
This will give us a project tentatively by in the range of 600-700 lines of code.
