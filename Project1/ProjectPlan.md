# **Project Plan -- Team 10**

1 Introduction
--------------

Our project is to develop software that computes the average number of words in a sentence for any given file.  
This software will be used in a classroom setting by students who have varying levels of computer knowledge.

2 Process Description
---------------------

We will be using the waterfall method for this project which will consist of the following steps:

**Software Concept Phase**

The first step for the project will be the creation of a software concept; the initial project idea will be  
elaborated and formed into an overview of the completed product. The overview will be a general description  
of the project, rather than a detailed set of steps, taking into account any known customer requrements  
and finishing with a project plan.

**Requirements Analysis**


- Detailed functional and non-functional requirements for the system will be developed in this phase.
Software and user interfaces must be considered while generating these requirements.
- Specific needs must be extracted from the customer in order to develop accurate requirements.
This can be done through interviews, surveys, or a variety of other requirements gathering methods.
- The end result of the requirements analysis phase will be a requirements document that specifies the 
characteristics of the system to be developed.

- Design
- In the design phase, we will figure out the best way to develop the system specified in the requirements.
We will determine what sort of objects will be needed and their relation to each other in the code and will represent this with diagrams.
Keep in mind that no actual code is written in this phase.
- Detailed requirements are needed before any sort of software design can occur.
- A complete set of diagrams detailing the design of the system as well as the contents of the user documentation (texual man page) will 
signify the end of the design phase.

- Coding and debugging
- In the coding and debugging phase, the design is implemented by developers.  This is the phase in which 
actual code is written and a product begins to emerge.  Period debugging shall be performed as issues are found.
- A detailed design of the system is necessary before any code can be written.
- Once a product emerges that fully implements the detailed design, the coding and debugging phase is complete.

- System testing
- The product which results from the coding and debugging phase now must be thoroughly tested.  Any differences between 
the product and the requirements should be caught in this phase.  A detailed set of test cases should be designed and 
executed on the system.
- Before testing can begin, there needs to be a complete product to test.  This product comes from the previous phase.
- All aspects of the requirements must be tested and must pass before testing stops.  Only then can our team be confident that the 
product matches the requirements and will satisfy the customer.

4 Estimates
-----------

Provide estimates for the following metrics:

This project should take team members around 50 effort hours total to complete.
Approximately 300 lines of code are expected to make up the final product.

- Effort hours: total number of team-member hours you expect to spend on the project
- Lines of code: total number of lines of source code you expect to have in your final product
