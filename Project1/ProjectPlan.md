# **Project Plan -- Team 10**

1-Introduction
--------------

Our project is to develop software that computes the average number of words in a sentence for any given file.  
This software will be used in a classroom setting by students who have varying levels of computer knowledge.

2-Process Description
---------------------

We will be using the waterfall method for this project which will consist of the following steps:

**Software Concept Phase**

The first step for the project will be the creation of a software concept; the initial project idea will be  
elaborated and formed into an overview of the completed product. The overview will be a general description  
of the project, rather than a detailed set of steps, taking into account any known customer requrements  
and finishing with a project plan.

**Requirements Analysis**

This phase will consist of gathering information regarding and developing functional and non-functional  
requirements for the system. In order to successfully complete this phase it is important to discover the  
specific needs from the customer to aid in developing accurate requirements and to prevent having to backtrack  
once the project is under way. Methods such as interviews, surveys, observation, research, and any other variety  
of requirements gathering methods are appropriate to ensure the success of the project as a whole. Once the  
needed information is acquired, functional and non-functional requirements will be developed and a requirements  
document, specifying the charactaristics of the system, will be completed.

**Design**

This phase will be where a decision is made regarding the best way to develop the system specified in the requirements.  
Once detailed requirements are complete we will begin the software design by determining the objects needed for the system  
and what relations they have with one another, not by writing any actual code, but by representing these relationships with  
diagrams. Once a complete set of diagrams, detailing the design of the system, and the contents of the user  
documentation (textual man page) is complete, the next phase will begin.

**Coding and Debugging**

In this phase, the design is implemented by the developers through code and a rough product begins to emerge. A detailed design  
is needed to ensure that all necessary code, and no extraneous code, is written to complete the desired project. To ensure  
success in all parts of the system, debugging and testing will be done as issues come up or after a section has been completed.  
Once enough rounds of testing and coding have been completed and a product exists that fully implements the detailed design,  
This phase will be complete.

**System Testing**

Once the Coding and Debugging phase is complete and a full product exists, that product must be thoroughly tested. The goal  
of this phase will be to discover any inconsistencied between the completed system and the requirements; this will be  
through a detailed set of test cases that will be designed with specific requirements in mind and executed on the system.  
The team cannot be confident in the product until all tests have been passed without issue and the system is successful  
in meeting all of the customer requirements.

4-Estimates
-----------

Provide estimates for the following metrics:

This project should take team members around 50 effort hours total to complete.
Approximately 300 lines of code are expected to make up the final product.

- Effort hours: total number of team-member hours you expect to spend on the project
- Lines of code: total number of lines of source code you expect to have in your final product
